**_STOP ANNOYING LEVELS_**

# SAL Extension 🐱‍🐉

_This extension focuses on fixing those audio level differences via a compressor_

A few things you should know:

* This uses a dynamic comp and a node gain, even tho' it's a very simple extension, it does not have the approach i would like. At the moment you can only "improve" the audio in videos since currently you cannot capture the audio directly fromt the tab due to a bug in the tabCapture API on manifest V3 apps.
* Feel free to colaborate.
