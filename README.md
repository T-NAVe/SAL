**_STOP ANNOYING LEVELS_**

## SAL Extension 🐱‍🐉

**_This extension focuses on fixing those audio level differences via a compressor_**

A few things you should know:

* This uses a dynamic comp and a node gain, even tho' it's a very simple extension, it does not have the approach i would like. At the moment you can only "improve" the audio in videos since currently you cannot capture the audio directly fromt the tab due to a bug in the tabCapture API on manifest V3 apps.
The issue mentioned can be followed in this thread [Chrome issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1214847) i will keep working on this extension from time to time. Check the Branch testing for a working solution.
* I know that the extension is currently a mess due to the multiple solutions i had to check due to the bug, but feel free to contribute.

## Starting 🚀

_Load the extension_
Follow this steps:

* Download/copy this repo in your computer (Use the branch named testing).
* Load the unpacked extension via chrome extension manager (Dev mode needs to be enabled).
* Open a video and press Turn on SAL button. (You will notice a change in gain, this means that the extension is active, if this does not happen refresh the page!)
* Done!
